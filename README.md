After cloning the repo, you will have to do the following:
1. Run: "composer u" to update all the dependencies

3. Run: "php artisan key:generate" to generate a unique application key. It will appear in the (.env) file
4. Run: "php artisan migrate" to create the database. NOTE: make sure you edit the database name in the (.env) & (.env.example) files
5. Run: "php artisan serve" to start a development server
